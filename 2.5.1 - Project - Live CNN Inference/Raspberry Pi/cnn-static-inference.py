Pi Camera Static Image Classification

Detects objects in continuous stream of images from Pi Camera. Use Edge Impulse
Runner and downloaded .eim model file to perform inference. Bounding box info is
drawn on top of detected objects along with framerate (FPS) in top-left corner.

Copy one of the test images to the same folder, rename image_file as necessary
(e.g. "48.png").
