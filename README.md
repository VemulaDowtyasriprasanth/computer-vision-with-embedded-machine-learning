# Computer Vision with Embedded Machine Learning

![Object detection on Raspberry Pi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShawnHymel/computer-vision-with-embedded-machine-learning/master/Images/object-detection.png)

This repository contains all of the code for the demonstrations, project prompts, and project solutions for the [Computer Vision with Embedded Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computer-vision-with-embedded-machine-learning) course. If you have not done so already, I highly recommend taking the [Introduction to Embedded Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-embedded-machine-learning) course first, as it covers many important concepts required for the computer vision course.

You will need a [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/) to run the Google Colab notebooks (e.g. image manipulation, data augmentation). You will also need an account on [Edge Impulse](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) to upload your datasets and train models.

The following hardware platforms are supported:

* [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with [Pi Camera v2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/)
* [OpenMV Camera H7](https://openmv.io/collections/products/products/openmv-cam-h7-r2) ([Plus model](https://openmv.io/collections/products/products/openmv-cam-h7-plus) recommended)
